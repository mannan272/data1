Safety,Safety index: decay index,"The decay index describes the degree of nuisance experienced by material decay in the public space (such as litter, destroyed street furniture and stench) and thus the impact on public safety in a neighbourhood. The index is based on questions from the survey Amsterdam-Amstelland Safety Monitor, completed by residents aged 15 and older. The value 100 represents the regional average (Safety Region Amsterdam-Amstelland) in the benchmark year 2021. Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year. The index is calculated at district level and is only suitable for a comparison between districts and for following the development of the district score. The higher the score, the more decay. The safety index has its own district classification (VM areas), whereby some districts from the standard district classification have been combined due to population numbers. If this is the case, the same index score is assigned to both districts, unless there are fewer than 50 respondents to the Safety Monitor in one or both districts."
Safety,Safety index: nuisance by people index,"The nuisance by people index describes the extent to which nuisance by people is experienced.

The index is based on nuisance reports to the police, nuisance reports to the municipality of Amsterdam and survey data from the Amsterdam-Amstelland Safety Monitor (completed by residents aged 15 and older). The value 100 represents the regional average (Safety Region Amsterdam-Amstelland) in the benchmark year 2021. Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year. The index is calculated at district level and is only suitable for a comparison between districts and for following the development of the district score.

If this is the case, the same score is assigned to both districts, unless there are less than 50 respondents to the Safety Monitor in one or both districts."
Safety,Safety index: unsafety perception index,"The unsafety perception index is the average score of three sub-indexes: risk perception, feelings of unsafety and avoidance. Risk perception is the assessment of the chance of becoming a victim of crime and nuisance. The feelings of unsafety map out whether and how often people feel unsafe or fearful of crime, and avoidance indicates the extent to which people avoid places or behavior because they feel unsafe in those situations. Risk perception is therefore the cognitive component, unsafe feelings the affective component and avoidance the conative component. The index is based on questions from the survey Amsterdam-Amstelland Safety Monitor, completed by residents aged 15 and older. The value 100 represents the regional average (Safety Region Amsterdam-Amstelland) in the benchmark year 2021. Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year. The index is calculated at district level and is only suitable for a comparison between districts and for following the development of the district score. The higher the score, the more perceived unsafety. The safety index has its own district classification (VM areas), whereby some districts from the standard neighborhood classification have been combined due to small population numbers. If this is the case, the same index score is assigned to both districts, unless there are fewer than 50 respondents to the Safety Monitor in one or both districts."
Safety,Safety index: risk perception index,"Risk perception is the estimate by residents aged 15 and older of the chance of becoming a victim of crime and nuisance and to what extent this occurs in their neighbourhood.

Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year.

Safety,Safety index: unsafe feelings index,"The feelings of unsafety map out whether and how often residents aged 15 and older feel unsafe or afraid of crime.

The value 100 represents the regional average (Safety Region Amsterdam-Amstelland) in the benchmark year 2021. Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year.

Safety,Safety index: avoidance index,"Avoidance indicates the extent to which residents aged 15 and older avoid places or behavior because they feel unsafe in those situations. Avoidance is thus a conative component of behaviour: the action. The index is based on questions from the survey Amsterdam-Amstelland Safety Monitor. The value 100 represents the regional average (Safety Region Amsterdam-Amstelland) in the benchmark year 2021. Each district score shows how the district compares to the regional average in the benchmark year. The index is calculated at district level and is only suitable for a comparison between districts and for following the development of the district score. The higher the score, the more avoidance behavior. The safety index has its own district classification (VM areas), whereby some districts from the standard district classification have been combined due to small population numbers. If this is the case, the same index score is assigned to both districts, unless there are fewer than 50 respondents to the Safety Monitor in one or both districts."
