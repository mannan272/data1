    "We begin by loading up the `mtcars` dataset. This data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises of fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). We will load this data to a dataframe with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables. Here is an explanation of the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mpg` is Miles/(US) gallon \n",
    "- `cyl` is Number of cylinders, \n",
    "- `disp` is\tDisplacement (cu.in.), \n",
    "- `hp` is\tGross horsepower, \n",
    "- `drat` is\tRear axle ratio, \n",
    "- `wt` is the Weight (1000 lbs), \n",
    "- `qsec` is 1/4 mile time,\n",
    "- `vs` is Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight), \n",
    "- `am` is Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual), \n",
    "- `gear` is the Number of forward gears, \n",
    "- `carb` is\tNumber of carburetors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see in **Exercise 5** of Homework 05, the first step you are required to complete to create a regression model using `sklearn` on the `mtcars` dataframe is to: \"load the data `mtcars` and split them into a training set and a test set.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While loading the dataframe and analysing its fundamnetal propoerties should be pretty easy for you at this stage, splitting the data into a training and testing set is a new step. Thus, let us complete this first step together. \n",
